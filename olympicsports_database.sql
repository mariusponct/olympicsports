In monoskiing, the user stands with feet inline with direction of travel (facing tip of monoski/downhill) (parallel to long axis of board), whereas in snowboarding, users stand with feet transverse (more or less) to the longitude of the board. Users of such equipment may be referred to as snowboarders. Commercial snowboards generally require extra equipment such as bindings and special boots which help secure both feet of a snowboarder, who generally rides in an upright position. These types of boards are commonly used by people at ski hills or resorts for leisure, entertainment, and competitive purposes in the activity called snowboarding.','images/snowboard_large.jpg','big air men, halfpipe men, parallel giant slalom men, slopestyle men, snowboard cross men','big air women, halfpipe women, parallel giant slalom women, slopestyle women, snowboard cross women'),(62,'speed skating','Speed skating is a competitive form of ice skating in which the competitors race each other in travelling a certain distance on skates.
